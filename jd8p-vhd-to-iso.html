I'll preface this with I've worked in IT for a few years, no longer do so anything that's considered basic to mid level problem solving, I've tried extensively. That includes wiping EVERYTHING routers, phones etc. Even with a new PC this problem persistied. Now to explain it I'm going to copy and paste from a form where a guy did a much better job of explaining it but what we have seems identical. Personally I think it's a targeted attack on myself.

I use Packer and the vmware-iso builder quite extensively with VMWare Workstation. I usually skip the export so I end up with a usable VM instead of just a VHD on disk. I'm able to use the Qemu builder to, with a bit of tweaking post-process, create qcow2 images that I can hack into an existing Proxmox VM by replacing the disk image that Proxmox creates during VM creation. This is sort of a jarring workaround compared to VMWare Workstation, where I run `packer build` and end up with a usable.

Good day! amp#x200B; We're currently using Veeam Agent (free version) to backup an image file of our servers. Unfortunately, it only creates vbk amp vbm files and not vhd files and the only way we can restore it is to: 1. Mount the custom ISO created by the agent 2. Install the OS 3. Select the restore point (.vbk amp vbm) That way it will restore the computer to its last saved point. Now we're planning to use Azure as our Cloud Backup Disaster Recovery. Is there a way to mount.

We want to make a copy of each of them that is virtualizable so that in the future if someone needs the server we can boot up the virtual server instead of needing to connect these 15 year old servers to our network. Each server has a 16GB (Yes, Gigabyte, not terabyte) system drive and then a \~110GB data drive set up in RAID from a combination of 3-4 physical drives. The servers boot normal.

Hello All.I need to recover an exchange VM that is sitting on a back sector from backup. Everywhere I look it references use the "Image Conversion Tool".Or. "Go to tools and you will see Image Conversion Tool.". Well I do not see this anywhere. Even their docs as recently as June 2018 says this.
